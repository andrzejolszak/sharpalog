# Sharpalog: C# Datalog Engine - a Sharpen port of Jatalog

This starts as a Sharpen port and C#-specific cleanup, but might diverge from Jatalog semantics in the future.

Please see the below description of [Jatalog](https://github.com/wernsey/Jatalog).

## Jatalog: Java Datalog Engine with Semi-Naive Evaluation and Stratified Negation

Datalog is a subset of the Prolog programming language that is used as a query language in deductive databases<sub>[wiki]</sub>.

Jatalog is a Datalog implementation in Java. It provides a parser for the language and an evaluation engine to 
execute queries that can be embedded into larger applications.

## Summary

* The engine implements semi-naive, bottom-up evaluation.
* It implements stratified negation; Technically, it implements the _Stratified Datalog&not;_ language<sub>[ceri]</sub>.
* It can parse and evaluate Datalog programs from files and Strings (actually anything that implements `java.io.Reader`).
* It has a fluent API through which it can be embedded in Java applications to run queries.
* It implements "=", "<>" (alternatively "!="), "<", "<=", ">" and ">=" as built-in predicates.
* It avoids third party dependencies.
* Values with "quoted strings" are supported.
* Retract facts with the `~` operator, for example `p(q,r)~`.
* The class `Shell` implements a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) command-line interface.

## Introduction

A Datalog program consists of facts and rules. Facts describe knowledge about the world. Rules describe the
relationships between facts from which new facts can be derived.

The following Datalog program describes that Alice is a parent of Bob and Bob is a parent of Carol, and then
provides rules for deriving an ancestor relationship from the facts<sub>[wiki]</sub>:

    % Facts:
    parent(alice, bob).
    parent(bob, carol).
    
    % Rules:
    ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
    ancestor(X, Y) :- ancestor(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).

Variables in Datalog are capitalized. In the example, `X`, `Y` and `Z` are variables, whereas `alice` and `bob`
are constants. Facts cannot contain variables - they are said to be _ground_.

The collection of facts is called the _Extensional Database_ (EDB).

In the fact `parent(alice, bob)` the `parent` is called the predicate, while `alice` and `bob` are the
terms. The number of terms is called the _arity_. The arity of `parent` is 2 and some literature will write it
as `parent/2`. It is expected that all facts with the same predicate will have the same arity.

In the example, the two facts

 * `parent(alice, bob)` reads "`alice` is a parent of `bob`"
 * `parent(bob, carol)` reads "`bob` is a parent of `carol`"

The collection of rules is called the _Intensional Database_ (IDB). Rules consist of a _head_ and a _body_, separated
by a `:-` symbol. The head of the rule describes a new fact that can be derived whereas the body describes how that
fact should be derived.

In the rule `ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y)` the `ancestor(X, Y)` is the head, and `parent(X, Y)` is
the body. It specifies that the fact "`X` is an ancestor of `Y`" can be derived if the fact "`X` is a parent of `Y`"
holds true. 

It is also said that the body of the rule _implies_ the head, so `parent(X, Y)` implies `ancestor(X, Y)`.

The Datalog engine will use this rule to determine that "`alice` is an ancestor of `bob`" and "`bob` is an ancestor 
of `carol`" when queries are executed.

The second rule `ancestor(X, Y) :- ancestor(X, Z), parent(Z, Y)` says that the fact "`X` is an ancestor of `Y`"
can also be derived if there exists a `Z` such that "`X` is an ancestor of `Z`" _and_ "`Z` is a parent of `Y`".

Using this rule, the Datalog engine will determine that "`alice` is an ancestor of `carol`" from all the other facts 
that have already been derived during query evaluation.

Queries can be run against the database once the facts and the rules have been entered into the system:

 * `ancestor(X, carol)?` queries "who are `carol`'s ancestors?"
 * `ancestor(alice, Y)?` queries "of who is `alice` the ancestor?"
 * `ancestor(alice, carol)?` asks "Is `alice` an ancestor of `carol`?"

Answers come in the form of a collection of the mapping of variable names to values that satisfy the query. For example, the
query `ancestor(X, carol)?`'s results will be `{X: alice}` and `{X: bob}`.

Jatalog implements some built-in predicates which can be used in rules and queries: equals "=", not equals "<>", greater than ">", greater or
equals ">=", less than "<" and less or equals "<=".

You can have multiple clauses in a query, separated by commas. For example `sibling(A, B), A <> alice?` asks "who are siblings of A where A is not `alice`?"

Additionally, Jatalog's syntax uses the `~` symbol for retracting facts form the database. For example, the statement `planet(pluto)~` will retract 
the fact that `pluto` is a `planet`. The syntax is adapted from [rack]'s, but it is unclear whether other Datalog 
implementations use it.

The retract query can contain variables and multiple clauses: The statement `thing(N, X), X > 5~` will delete all _things_
from the database where `X` is greater than 5. 

### Fluent API

In addition to an interpreter for the Datalog language, Jatalog also provides an API through which the database can be accessed and
queried directly in Java programs.

The following is an example of how the facts and the rules from above example can be written using the Fluent API:

    Jatalog jatalog = new Jatalog();
    
    jatalog.fact("parent", "alice", "bob")
        .fact("parent", "bob", "carol");
    
    jatalog.rule(Expr.expr("ancestor", "X", "Y"), Expr.expr("parent", "X", "Z"), Expr.expr("ancestor", "Z", "Y"))
        .rule(Expr.expr("ancestor", "X", "Y"), Expr.expr("parent", "X", "Y"));

The queries can then then be executed as follows:

    Collection<Map<String, String>> answers;
    answers = jatalog.query(Expr.expr("ancestor", "X", "carol"));

The `answers` collection will contain a list of all the variable mappings that satisfy the query:

    {X: alice}
    {X: bob}

The query from the previous example can also be written as

    answers = jatalog.executeAll("ancestor(X, carol)?");

Jatalog also provides a `Jatalog.prepareStatement()` method that will parse strings into `Statement` objects
that can be executed later. The `Statement.execute()` method takes a `Map<String, String>` of variable bindings
as a parameter, so that it can be used to do batch inserts or queries. For example: 

    Statement statement = Jatalog.prepareStatement("sibling(Me, You)?");
    Map<String, String> bindings = Jatalog.makeBindings("Me", "bob");
    Collection<Map<String, String>> answers;
    answers = statement.execute(jatalog, bindings);
    
In the above example, the variable `Me` is bound to the value `bob`, so the `statement.execute(...)` line is equivalent to
executing the query `sibling(bob, You)?`.

The Javadoc documentation contains more information and the unit tests in the `src/test` directory contain some more examples.

### Implementation

Jatalog's evaluation engine is bottom-up, semi-naive with stratified negation.

_Bottom-up_ means that the evaluator will start with all the known facts in the EDB and use the rules to derive new facts.
It will repeat this process until no more new facts can be derived. It will then match all of the facts to the goal of the
query to determine the answer (The alternative is _top-down_, where the evaluator starts with a series of goals and use the
rules and facts in the database to prove those goals).

_Semi-naive_ is an optimization of the Datalog engine wherein the evaluator will only consider a subset of the rules that may 
be affected by facts derived during the previous iteration, rather than all of the rules in the IDB.

_Stratified negation_ means that the order in which rules are evaluated are arranged in such a way that negated goals cause
sensible facts to be derived. 

Consider, for example, the rule `p(X) :- q(X), not r(X).` with the fact `q(a)` present in the EDB, but not `r(a)`, 
and suppose that there are other rules in the database that imply `p(X)` and `r(X)`. If the engine were to evaluate these rules 
naively then it will derive the fact `p(a)` in the initial iteration. It is then possible that the fact `r(a)` may 
be derived in a subsequent iteration, which results in the facts `p(a)` and `r(a)` contradicting each other.

The stratified negation evaluates the rules in an order such that all the `r(X)` facts are derived before any of the `p(X)` 
facts can be derived which eliminates such contradictions.

Stratified negation puts additional constraints on the usage of negated expressions in Jatalog, which the engine checks for.

## Usage

If you want to use the Java API, you just need to add the compiled JAR to your classpath.

The `Main-Class` in the JAR's manifest points to `za.co.wstoop.jatalog.Shell`, which implements the REPL interface. To start 
the interpreter, simply run the JAR file with the Java `-jar` command-line option.

### With Maven

The preferred method of building Jatalog is through [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

    # Compile like so:
    mvn package
    
    # Generate Javadocs
    mvn javadoc:javadoc

    # Run like so:
    java -jar target/jatalog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file.dl

Where `file.dl` is the name of a file containing Datalog commands to be executed. It is omitted, the interpreter will enter
an interactive mode where commands will be read from `System.in`
    
### With Ant

An [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) `build.xml` file is also provided:

    # Compile like so:
    ant 
    
    # Generate Javadocs
    ant docs
    
    # Run like so:
    java -jar dist/jatalog-0.9.jar

## Ideas and Notes

_Just some thoughts on how the system is currently implemented and how it can be improved in the future_

----

There are opportunities to run some of the methods in parallel using the Java 8 Streams API (I'm thinking of the calls to 
`expandStrata()` in `expandDatabase()` and the calls to `matchRule()` in `expandStrata()` in particular).

This is a bit more complicated than I thought it would be because

1. `expandStrata()` would need a special `Collector` to collect new facts into the `IndexedSet`, and
2. The `facts` parameter passed to `expandStrata()` from `expandDatabase()` is modified at the end of 
   the loop in `expandStrata()`.

I can use a method like this to make the type of stream configurable:

    private <T> Stream<T> stream(Collection<T> c) {
    	return (useParallel)?c.parallelStream():c.stream();
    }

----

I've decided against arithmetic built-in predicates, such as `plus(X,Y,Z) => X + Y = Z`, for now:

* Arithmetic predicates aren't that simple. They should be evaluated as soon as the input 
   variables (X and Y) in this case becomes available, so that Z can be computed and bound for the remaining goals.
* Arithmetic expressions would require a more complex parser and there would be a need for `Expr` to have 
   child `Expr` objects to build a parse tree. The parse tree would be simpler if the `terms` of 
   `Expr` was a `List<Object>` - see my note below.

----

It is conceptually possible to make the `List<String> terms` of `Expr` a `List<Object>` instead, so that 
you can store complex Java objects in the database (as POJOs). 

The `isVariable()` method will just have to be modified to check whether its parameter is `instanceof` String 
and starts with an upper-case character, the bindings will become a `Map<String, Object>`, the result of 
`query()` will be a `List<Map<String, Object>>` and a couple of `toString()` methods will have to be modified. 

It won't be that useful a feature if you just use the interpreter, but it could be a *nice-to-have* if you use the fluent API. 
I don't intend to implement it at the moment, though.
